    Allows for creating and managing Groups within Keycloak.
    Groups provide a logical wrapping for users within Keycloak. Users within a
    group can share attributes and roles, and group membership can be mapped
    to a claim.
    Groups can also be federated from external data sources, such as LDAP or Active Directory.
    This resource **should not** be used to manage groups that were created this way.
example: |
    resource "keycloak_realm" "realm" {
       realm   = "my-realm"
       enabled = true
    }
    resource "keycloak_group" "parent_group" {
    realm_id = "${keycloak_realm.realm.id}"
    name     = "parent-group"
    }
    resource "keycloak_group" "child_group" {
    realm_id  = "${keycloak_realm.realm.id}"
    parent_id = "${keycloak_group.parent_group.id}"
    name      = "child-group"
    }
import: |
    Groups can be imported using the format `{{realm_id}}/{{group_id}}`, where `group_id` is the unique ID that Keycloak
    assigns to the group upon creation. This value can be found in the URI when editing this group in the GUI, and is typically a GUID.
     Example:
     ```bash
    $ terraform import keycloak_group.child_group my-realm/934a4a4e-28bd-4703-a0fa-332df153aabd
    ```
